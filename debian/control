Description: Solaris name-value library for Linux
 This library provides routines for packing and unpacking nv pairs for
 transporting data across process boundaries, transporting between
 kernel and userland, and possibly saving onto disk files.

Package: libuutil1linux
Section: contrib/libs
Architecture: linux-any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Solaris userland utility library for Linux
 This library provides a variety of glue functions for ZFS on Linux:
  * libspl: The Solaris Porting Layer userland library, which provides APIs
    that make it possible to run Solaris user code in a Linux environment
    with relatively minimal modification.
  * libavl: The Adelson-Velskii Landis balanced binary tree manipulation
    library.
  * libefi: The Extensible Firmware Interface library for GUID disk
    partitioning.
  * libshare: NFS, SMB, and iSCSI service integration for ZFS.

Description: OpenZFS filesystem development files for Linux
 Header files and static libraries for compiling software against
 libraries of OpenZFS filesystem.
 .
 This package includes the development files of libnvpair1, libuutil1,
 libzpool2 and libzfs2.

Package: libzfs2linux
Section: contrib/libs
Architecture: linux-any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: OpenZFS filesystem library for Linux
 The Z file system is a pooled filesystem designed for maximum data
 integrity, supporting data snapshots, multiple copies, and data
 checksums.
 .
 The OpenZFS library provides support for managing OpenZFS filesystems.

Package: libzpool2linux

Description: A wrapper for libzfs_core C library
 libzfs_core is intended to be a stable interface for programmatic
 administration of ZFS. This wrapper provides one-to-one wrappers for
 libzfs_core API functions, but the signatures and types are more natural to
 Python.
 .
 nvlists are wrapped as dictionaries or lists depending on their usage.
 Some parameters have default values depending on typical use for
 increased convenience. Enumerations and bit flags become strings and lists
 of strings in Python. Errors are reported as exceptions rather than integer
 errno-style error codes.  The wrapper takes care to provide one-to-many
 mapping of the error codes to the exceptions by interpreting a context
 in which the error code is produced.
 .
 This package contains the python version 2 library.
